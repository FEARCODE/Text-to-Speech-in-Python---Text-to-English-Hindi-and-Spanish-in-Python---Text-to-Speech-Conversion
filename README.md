Text to Speech in Python - Text to English, Hindi, and Spanish in Python - Text to Speech Conversion in Python


There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in python. One of such APIs is the Google Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API. gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file.

The gTTS API supports several languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, French, German and many more. The speech can be delivered in any one of the two available audio speeds, fast or slow. However, as of the latest update, it is not possible to change the voice of the generated audio

To install the gTTS API, open terminal and write

pip install gTTS
This works for any platform.

Python Text To Speech | pyttsx module
pyttsx is a cross-platform text to speech library which is platform independent. The major advantage of using this library for text-to-speech conversion is that it works offline. However, pyttsx supports only Python 2.x. Hence, we will see pyttsx3 which is modified to work on both Python 2.x and Python 3.x with the same code.

Use this command for Installation:

pip install pyttsx3

Why pyttsx?
It works offline, unlike other text-to-speech libraries. Rather than saving the text as audio file, pyttsx actually speaks it there. This makes it more reliable to use for voice-based projects.
